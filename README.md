# SOLID Principles in Dart

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of SOLID principles in Dart. SOLID is a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles are:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Project Structure

- **lib/**
  - Contains the Dart source code for the project, organized into modules demonstrating each SOLID principle.
- **test/**
  - Contains unit tests to ensure the correct implementation of SOLID principles.
